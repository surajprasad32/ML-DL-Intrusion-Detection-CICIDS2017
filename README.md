# ðŸš€ ML-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using CICIDS2017

This project implements a Machine Learningâ€“based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) trained on the **CICIDS2017 dataset**.  
The system detects various network attacks (e.g., DoS, DDoS, Brute Force, PortScan) using classical and deep learning models.

## ðŸ§  Features
- Preprocessing of CICIDS2017 flows
- Handling of missing values & normalization
- SMOTE for class imbalance correction
- Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network models
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)
- Colab-ready for GPU acceleration
